# Literotica Downloader
Adds download buttons to series and stories on Literotica.

A complete rewrite of the [original script by Patrick Kolodziejczyk](https://www.reddit.com/r/literotica/comments/7a2e2u/chromefirefoxliterotica_story_and_series_download/)


## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey **Beta**) installed to run this script. The extension muss support `GM_download` (Tampermonkey Beta does, the current regular Tampermonkey extension does not support the downloads required by this script).

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/Literotica-Downloader/raw/master/Literotica-Downloader.user.js)

For the downloads to work you may have to add `.html` files to the "Whitelisted File Extensions" in the download settings of your UserScript extension.  
How to do this in Tampermonkey Beta:

- Click on the Tampermonkey Beta button and click on **Dashboard**
- Go to the **Settings** tab
- At the very top make sure that **Config mode** is set to **Beginner** or **Advanced** (if set to *Novice* you cannot modify the whitelist)
- Scroll down until you reach the **Downloads BETA** section
- In the textbox **Whitelisted File Extensions** add a line with `.html`
